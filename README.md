# CBL-Mariner-DE
Components for building Xfce DE in CBL-Mariner.

Why did I make this? because there is no package in the repository and it is difficult to reset it manually. I have tried to do it due to limited knowledge I gave up and needed help. I hope someone can help.

# Source
Looks like some are already available in repositories like x11, xorg etc. but I don't know if everything is working or not. The last time I try to starx, the screen freeze.
