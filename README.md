# Azure Linux Desktop Environment
Azure Linux, previously known as CBL-Mariner (in which CBL stands for Common Base Linux), is a free and open-source Linux distribution that Microsoft has developed. It is the base container OS for Microsoft Azure services and the graphical component of WSL 2. But in this time, i installed xfce with a little customization.
